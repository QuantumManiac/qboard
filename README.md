## BOM
A BOM of parts used can be found [here](https://github.com/QuantumManiac/qboard/tree/main/bom)

## Firmware
Rough notes for configuring the MCU and flashing firmware can be found [here](https://github.com/QuantumManiac/qboard/tree/main/qmk_firmware)

## Improvements
- Improving on the numpad connector - don't fit well and when connected isn't sturdy
- Switching out direct soldering of keyswitches onto PCB with hot-swap sockets
